Pi Day Website
To Promote online giving to Renssellaer on March 14, 2014. 

Do not publicize widely. 
This website will not be officially launched until March 10, 2014.

Feel free to recommend changes. In particular, I'm interested in additions to make the site run faster and to be more accessible.
